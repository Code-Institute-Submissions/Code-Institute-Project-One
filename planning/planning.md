--------------------------

<!-- To do -->

- reorganise css
    classes > element targetting (instead of new classes)
    new sheet for seperate pages - main,
    look into compiler
    *create common style classes like 'skin' - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/
    reusable classes of common styles

- Decide on background for other pages and then figure out footer layout
- Make sure all fonts are styled correctly
- Figure out how I want about page content aligned on desktop (once I've written the actual content)
- Double check footer positioning is same on all pages and sizes
- change all hex to 6 digit, change white text to off white hex or rgba for nav links
- don't forget modal styling
- remove m-0 class from headers

<!-- Text styling -->
Font spacing, family, size, weight.. check all

<!-- extra stuff -->
- add tapering borders to mobile nav
- map link to address
- products dropdown menu for desktop
- b2b enquiries contact us


footer-text--mobile > footer-mobile--text
remove font weights that aren't in use
ensure footer content, links, etc same on all pages
