                <h5>What are Cybernetics?</h5>
                <p>Cybernetics is "the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine," according to Norbert Wiener, the originator of the field. For us, this means understanding how living cells communicate and how we can influence this with machines. A cyborg is a biological creature that has been integrated with a machine.</p>
